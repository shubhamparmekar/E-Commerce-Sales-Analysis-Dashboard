## Prerequisites

- **Power BI Desktop**: Download and install [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

## Installation

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/shubhamparmekar/E-Commerce-Sales-Analysis-Dashboard.git
    ```

2. **Download Power BI Desktop**

    - Go to the [Power BI Desktop](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/) download page.

## Data Loading and Transformation

1. **Open Power BI Desktop**

    Launch Power BI Desktop after installation.

2. **Load Data**

    - Click on `Get Data` in the Home tab.
    - Select the data source type (e.g., Excel, CSV, SQL Server, etc.) and locate your dataset. For this project, assume you are using an Excel file named `ecommerce_data.xlsx`.

3. **Transform Data**

    - After loading the data, click on `Transform Data` to open Power Query Editor.
    - Perform necessary transformations such as:
      - Removing unnecessary columns.
      - Renaming columns for clarity.
      - Handling missing or duplicate values.
      - Creating new calculated columns if needed (e.g., calculating total sales from unit price and quantity).

    Hereâ€™s an example of a transformation step to create a new column for total sales:

    ```plaintext
    Total Sales = [Unit Price] * [Quantity]
    ```

    - Once all transformations are complete, click `Close & Apply` to apply the changes and load the transformed data into Power BI.

## Data Visualization
